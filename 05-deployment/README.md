Basically homework is about predicting whether client with specified info will get a credit. Response looks like this (`[[negative positive]]` outcome): 

```
[[0.09806907 0.90193093]]
```
Here "client gets credit" with `0.9` certainty. Can be thresholded for `true/false` or human-language outcomes, but that's not in the task of the homework.

There are few options to "run" (serve) this homework:

- gunicorn serve (unix):
`gunicorn --bind localhost:9696 script:app`

- waitress serve (windows):
`waitress-serve --listen=localhost:9696 script:app`

It can also be served just via [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) or [gevent.pywsgi](http://www.gevent.org/api/gevent.pywsgi.html), although according parts in `script.py` should be uncommented. For both just run `python script.py` via terminal.

For testing [test.py](test.py) can be used, or just `curl` (`/predict1` and `/predict2` are endpoints for 2 different models):

```
curl 127.0.0.1:9696/ping
```

```
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"job\": \"unknown\", \"duration\": 270, \"poutcome\": \"failure\"}" http://localhost:9696/predict1
```

```
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"job\": \"retired\", \"duration\": 445, \"poutcome\": \"success\"}" http://localhost:9696/predict2
```
